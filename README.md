HAWI-AI

Decentralized AI Knowledge Companion for DeFi — Built on the Internet Computer

Overview
HAWI-AI is a decentralized AI-powered assistant designed to help users understand Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in a simple, secure, and interactive way.
The platform uses AI running on the Internet Computer (ICP) to provide users with explanations, learning guidance, and insights about DeFi without relying on external APIs.
Unlike traditional AI assistants, HAWI-AI runs fully on-chain, ensuring privacy, transparency, and decentralization.

Problem
The DeFi ecosystem is growing rapidly, but many users face major challenges:
Lack of clear educational resources
Complex technical terminology
High risk of scams and misinformation
Limited AI tools that respect user privacy

Most AI tools rely on centralized APIs, which introduces issues like:
Data privacy concerns
API costs
Dependence on centralized providers

Solution
HAWI-AI solves these problems by providing:
A decentralized AI assistant
DeFi education through interactive chat
On-chain AI inference using Internet Computer canisters
No external APIs
Private and secure user interaction
Users can ask questions about DeFi and receive intelligent responses directly from the blockchain.

Key Features
AI Chat Interface
Ask questions about DeFi concepts, protocols, and blockchain topics.
Fully On-Chain AI
Uses LLM canisters on the Internet Computer instead of external APIs.
Decentralized Architecture
All backend logic runs in Motoko smart contracts (canisters).
Interactive UI
Modern interface built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
Secure & Private
No centralized servers handling AI requests.
